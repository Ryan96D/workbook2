My toaster's a liar, it burns all my bread,
The fridge hums a tune that lives in my head.
I asked my goldfish for life advice,
It blinked at me once, then blinked twice.
The carpet's a sea, my socks are two boats,
My lamp whispers secrets in flickering notes.
I wrote this poem to confuse and dismay,
Because nonsense is fun, come what may!
